# Fubonacci numbers 
_History of the Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is named for Leonardo Pisano (also known Fibonacci), an Italian mathematician who lived from 1170 to 1250. Fibonacci considered the sequence to be an answer to the following question:_
* "How many pairs of rabbits will be produced in a year, beginning with a single pair, if in every month each pair bears a new pair which becomes productive from the second month on?" The result can be expressed numerically as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

* Fibonacci numbers can also be used to define a spiral and are of interest to biologists and physicists because they are frequently observed in various natural objects and phenomena. The branching patterns in trees and leaves, for example, and the distribution of seeds in a raspberry reflect the Fibonacci sequence.

#### The Fibonacci sequence is often associated with the golden ratio, a proportion (roughly 1:1.6) that occurs frequently throughout the natural world and is applied across many areas of human endeavor. Both the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio are used to guide design for architecture, websites and user interfaces, among other things.
 # C# fibonacci numbers
 lets start
  so firs we can count fiboancci infinitive in a program :ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

then we count fibaonacci number use this method

 if you are intenrested in my program show demo version here ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
